<h1 align="center"> Figurate Numbers </h1>

**Figurate Numbers** is the most comprehensive and specialized library for figurate numbers, developed in Ruby to date.
It implements **241 infinite number sequences** inspired by the groundbreaking work [*Figurate Numbers*](https://books.google.com.pe/books/about/Figurate_Numbers.html?id=ERS7CgAAQBAJ&redir_esc=y) by Elena Deza and Michel Deza, published in 2012.

## 💎 Installation

Install it from the gem repository:

```rb
gem install figurate_numbers
```

## 🧊 Features
**Figurate Numbers** leverages Ruby’s `Enumerator` class to generate **241 infinite mathematical sequences**, based on geometric dimensions. It's ideal for use in mathematical modeling, algorithmic composition, and integration with tools like Sonic Pi.

The sequences are organized following the structure of the *Figurate Numbers* book:

-  🟦 **PlaneFigurateNumbers** – 79 sequences (2D)
-  🟥 **SpaceFigurateNumbers** – 86 sequences (3D)
-  🟨 **MultiDimensionalFigurateNumbers** – 70 sequences (4D and beyond)
-  🧬 **Zoo of figurate-related numbers** – 6 additional sequences *(included in the MultiDimensional module)*

##  🧰 How to use in Ruby

```rb
require 'figurate_numbers'

## Using take(integer)
FigurateNumbers.pentatope.take(10)

## Storing and iterating
f = FigurateNumbers.centered_octagonal_pyramid
f.next
f.next
f.next
```

If the sequence is defined with `lazy`, to make the numbers explicit we must include the converter method `to_a` at the end.

Since version **1.4.0**, you can alternatively call from the classes
```rb
PlaneFigurateNumbers.polygonal(3)
SpaceFigurateNumbers.rhombic_dodecahedral
MultiDimensionalFigurateNumbers.six_dimensional_hyperoctahedron
```

This ensures that you only use the numbers belonging to each geometric dimension.

## 🎶 How to use in Sonic Pi

### Version 1.4.0

Starting from version **1.4.0**, you can use the library globally through `FigurateNumbers`to access all sequences, or you can use the specific classes mentioned above for separate access.
The main change compared to version **1.3.0** is that you now need to import the file using **require** instead of **run_file**; otherwise, it will not function.

```rb
require "<PATH>"
pol_num = FigurateNumbers.polygonal(8)
350.times do
  play pol_num.next % 12 * 7  # Some mathematical function or transformation
  sleep 0.125
end
```

Simply copy the entry point path from the `lib/figurate_numbers.rb` file where the *gem* is installed.

### Version 1.3.0 (legacy)

See discussion in the [**Sonic Pi community thread right here!**](https://in-thread.sonic-pi.net/t/figurate-numbers-for-sonic-pi-new-ruby-gem-for-infinite-number-sequences-and-patterns/8962)
