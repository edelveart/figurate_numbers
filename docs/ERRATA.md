# Errata

- **Chapter 1, page 6:**
  The formula for *Square* in the table is given as:
  `1/2 (n^2 - 0 * n)`
  It should be corrected to:
  `1/2 (2n^2 - 0 * n)`

- **Chapter 1, page 51:**
  The formula for *Centered icosihexagonal* numbers is listed as:
  `1/3n^2 - 13n + 1`
  with values `546, 728, 936, 1170`.
  The correct formula and values are:
  `13n^2 - 13n + 1`
  with values `547, 729, 937, 1171`.

- **Chapter 1, page 51:**
  The value for *Centered icosiheptagonal* number is given as `972`.
  The correct value is `973`.

- **Chapter 1, page 51:**
  The value for *Centered icosioctagonal* number is given as `84`.
  The correct value is `85`.

- **Chapter 1, page 65:**
  The term *polite numbers* is misspelled as:
  `inpolite numbers`
  It should read:
  `impolite numbers`

- **Chapter 1, page 72:**
  The formula for truncated centered pentagonal numbers (TCSS_5) is:
  `TCSS_5(n) = (35n^2 - 55n) / 2 + 3`
  It should be:
  `TCSS_5(n) = (35n^2 - 55n) / 2 + 11`

- **Chapter 2, page 92:**
  The formula for octagonal pyramidal numbers is stated as:
  `n(n+1)(6n-1) / 6`
  The correct formula is:
  `n(n+1)(6n-3) / 6`

- **Chapter 2, page 140:**
  The sequence for centered square pyramidal numbers is listed as:
  `1, 6, 19, 44, 85, 111, 146, 231, ...`
  The number `111` should be excluded, resulting in:
  `1, 6, 19, 44, 85, 146, 231, ...`

- **Chapter 2, page 155:**
  The formula for generalized centered tetrahedron numbers (S_3^3) is:
  `S_3^3(n) = ((2n - 1)(n^2 + n + 3)) / 3`
  It should include a negative sign:
  `S_3^3(n) = ((2n - 1)(n^2 - n + 3)) / 3`

- **Chapter 2, page 156:**
  The formula for generalized centered square pyramid numbers (S_4^3) is:
  `S_4^3(n) = ((2n - 1)(n^2 - n + 2)^2) / 3`
  The correct formula is:
  `S_4^3(n) = ((2n - 1)(n^2 - n + 2)) / 2`

- **Chapter 3, page 188:**
  The term *hyperoctahedral numbers* is incorrectly called:
  `hexadecahoron numbers`
  It should be:
  `hexadecachoron numbers`

- **Chapter 3, page 190:**
  The term *hypericosahedral numbers* is incorrectly written as:
  `hexacisihoron numbers`
  It should be:
  `hexacosichoron numbers`
